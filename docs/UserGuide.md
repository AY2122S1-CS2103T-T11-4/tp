## 1. Introduction
***

DukePro(f) is an application that assists **professors in the University** in planning for their weekly engagements.
Amidst long hours of lectures and tutorials in the week, professors may still need to cater timeslots for **student
consultations**, which can be hard to come by and difficult to keep track of.

It is named `DukePro(f)` (Duke-Professor) because our project's target audience is professors in a University, and it is also a nod
to our CS2103T iP (individual Project), which was named `Duke`.

## 2. Purpose
***

This document is the User Guide for DukePro(f). It is intended to provide all the necessary information to use this software.
The manual assumes that the user has the ability to type fast and prefers typing over other means of input.
This User Guide contains the following sections:
1. Command Summary (TODO HYPERLINKS)
2. Quick Start
3. Features
4. FAQ

   Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

6. Refer to the [Features](#3-features) below for details of each command.


## 5. Features
***
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  * e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Lulu Yousef`.

* Items in square brackets are optional. (Items not in square brackets are necessary!)
  * e.g. `[tag/TAG]` is an optional parameter.

* Parameters that can have more than one entry will be anteceded by a `...`
  * e.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can have more than one entry, so `tag/supplmentary tag/important` is accepted.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  * e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DATE`, `d/DATE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you have specified it multiple times, only the 
  last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  * e.g. if you specify `t/0100 t/2359`, only `t/2359` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `exit`) will be 
  ignored.<br>
  * e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
