<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  * e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Lulu Yousef`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
  * e.g. `[tag/TAG]` is an optional parameter.

* Parameters can have more than one entry will be anteceded by a `...`
  * e.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can have more than one entry, so `tag/supplmentary tag/important` is accepted.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  * e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DATE`, `d/DATE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you have specified it multiple times, only the 
  last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  * e.g. if you specify `t/0100 t/2359`, only `t/2359` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `exit`) will be 
  ignored.<br>
  * e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
