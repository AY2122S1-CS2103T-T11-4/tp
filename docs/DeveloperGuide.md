### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Event` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ScheduleParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an event).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ScheduleParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ScheduleParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the schedule data i.e., all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `SortEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Schedule`, which `Event` references. This allows `Schedule` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Event` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both schedule data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ScheduleStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### SortedEventList - Galvin
#### Description
The `SortedEventList` class provides an abstraction over an internal list of `Events`. 

#### Implementation
The `SortedEventList` class contains 2 fields, `internalList` and `internalUnmodifiableList`.

The `internalList` is an `ObservableArrayList` that is not sorted.

The `internalUnmodifiableList` is a `SortedList` that wraps around the `internalList` to maintain the sorted property of Events

The `SortedEventList#asUnmodifiableObservableList()` method returns an ObservableList that `Schedule` uses as a field to store events. This ObservableList will have its Events sorted chronologically.

### UpcomingEventsCommand - Lulu
#### Description
The `UpcomingEventCommand` class is a command that lists all the events scheduled for the current day.

#### Implementation
The `UpcomingEventsCommand` class has one field `datePredicate` of type `EventContainsTodaysDatePredicate`.

`EventContainsTodaysDatePredicate` is  a class that checks whether an event's date matches today's date.

The `UpcomingEventsCommand` utilizes the `updateFilteredEventList()` method in the `Model` class to return an updated filtered event list that is filtered by the `datePredicate`.

### NextEventCommand - Lulu
#### Description
The `NextEventCommand` class is a command that displays the next event based on the current time in the schedule.

#### Implementation
The `NextEventCommand` class has one field timePredicate of type EventContainsCurrentTimePredicate.

`EventContainsCurrentTimePredicate` is  a class that checks whether an event's timeslot is after the current time.

The `NextEventCommand` utilizes the `updateFilteredEventList()` method in the `Model` class to return an updated filtered upcoming event that is filtered by the `timePredicate`.
Next, it gets the first event in the filtered list using the overridden method `nextEventInTheList()` found in the `ModelManager` class.


### Remark feature - Ruth

#### Description

The remark feature is an optional description added to `Event`. It adds a remark to the
consultation event, and is stored internally as a `Remark` in `seedu.address.model.event.Event`.

#### Implementation

The `Remark` class has one field `value` of type String.

Unlike the other Objects in `Event`, all `Remark` inputs are valid, and hence do not need to check for Validity, unless the input is `null`.

There are two ways the remark can be added to an `Event`:
* `AddCommand(Event)` method  — Adds a new `Event` to the list (now with an optional remark description attached to it).
* `EditCommand(Event)` method — Edits the remark description of an existing `Event` on the list.

As a Remark is an optional input, if user does not input any remarks when adding a new event, the Remark will simply be stored as an empty String `””` in `Remark` in `Event` as default.

To display the remark in the GUI, a new `Label` called `remark` is added to `EventCard` as well as `EventListCard.fxml`.

### TimeSlot - Teng Foong
#### Description

The `TimeSlot` class encapsulates the concept of an Event taking up a certain time period.

#### Implementation

The `TimeSlot` class has 2 fields, `startTime` and `endTime` and their values hold what their names imply.

A `TimeSlot` can be compared to another `TimeSlot` and this is done **only** using their `startTime` fields.

### CommandSummaryCommand - Jacob
#### Description

The `CommandSummaryCommand` class is a command that opens a pop-up window containing a Command Summary of DukePro(f)'s
possible commands.

#### Implementation

This implementation of this command adds another parameter `showCommands` (which has a default value of `false`) to the 
constructor of `CommandResult`.

When the command `command_summary` is input by the user, `LogicManager` parses the input and returns a 
`CommandSummaryCommand`. The `execute` method is called with the `showCommands` parameter being set to `true`. 
This causes `MainWindow` to execute the `handleCommandSummary` method, which opens the Command Summary Page.

### BlockedSlot - Teng Foong
#### Description

The `BlockedSlot` class represents a period of time that was blocked off by the user intentionally so that it is not possible for a new `Event` to be created during that time.

#### Implementation

The `BlockedSlot` class and `Event` class both implement the `Overlappable` interface. `Overlappable#isOverlappedWith` can be used to check for overlaps between `Overlappable`s.

The `block` command adds a new `BlockedSlot` to the `SortedBlockedSlotList`. When adding a new `Event` we search through
the `SortedBlockedSlotList` to check whether the `Date` and `TimeSlot` of the Event `isBlocked()`. The add command only
succeeds if `isBlocked()` returns false.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSchedule`. It extends `Schedule` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `scheduleStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSchedule#commit()` — Saves the current schedule state in its history.
* `VersionedSchedule#undo()` — Restores the previous schedule state from its history.
* `VersionedSchedule#redo()` — Restores a previously undone schedule state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSchedule()`, `Model#undoSchedule()` and `Model#redoSchedule()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSchedule` will be initialized with the initial schedule state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single schedule state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th event in the schedule. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSchedule()`, causing the modified state of the schedule after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `scheduleStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted schedule state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new event. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitSchedule()`, causing another modified schedule state to be saved into the `scheduleStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSchedule()`, so the schedule state will not be saved into the `scheduleStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the event was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSchedule()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous schedule state, and restores the schedule to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Schedule state, then there are no previous Schedule states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSchedule()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoSchedule()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the schedule to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `scheduleStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest schedule state, then there are no undone Schedule states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSchedule()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the schedule, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSchedule()`, `Model#undoSchedule()` or `Model#redoSchedule()`. Thus, the `scheduleStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitSchedule()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `scheduleStateList`, all schedule states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire schedule.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the event being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
