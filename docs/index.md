DukePro(f) is an application that assists **professors in the university** in planning for their weekly engagements.
Amidst long hours of lectures and tutorials in the week, professors may still need to cater timeslots for **student
consultations**, which can be hard to come by and difficult to keep track of.

It is named `DukePro(f)` (Duke-Professor) because our project's target audience is professors, and it is also a nod
to our CS2103T iP (individual Project), which was named `Duke`.

<hr />

With DukePro(f), professors will be able to:

* block out timeslots for lecture/tutorial/personal commitments
* query for available consultation timeslots
* add, delete or edit consultation timeslots
* list all consultation timeslots
