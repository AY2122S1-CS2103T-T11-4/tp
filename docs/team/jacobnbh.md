### Project: DukePro(f)

DukePro(f) is a schedule-planning desktop application that assists university professors in managing their 
consultations.The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and 
has about XX Loc.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added Command Summary Command feature.
    * What it does: opens a window that shows a list of all available commands.
    * Justification: New users may want a quick and easy view of all available commands for DukePro(f) instead of 
  referring to the User Guide every time.
* **New Feature**: Added colour-coded `URGENT` and `supplementary` tags.
    * What it does: colour codes `URGENT` tags to red and `supplementary` tags to yellow to show consultation 
  severity
    * Justification: Professors may want to tag their consultations with severity level tags to know which ones they
  should prioritise
